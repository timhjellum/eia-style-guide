<h2 class="uk-heading-small">Images of&nbsp;Text</h2>
<p>In general, websites should avoid images of text. Images of text are best reserved when a particular visual presentation is essential, such as a logo. If the image is of a small amount of text, the <code>alt</code> text must match the text in the image exactly. If the image contains a considerable amount of text, the text should also be elsewhere on the page.</p>
<p>In general, text in images should be a generous size to mitigate pixelation when zoomed. A minimum size of 19px is a good rule of thumb, with larger being better. Text in images should match color contrast ratio minimums. For text that is at least 24px and normal weight or 19px and bold, use a contrast ratio that is at least 3:1. Ideally, use a contrast ratio that is at least 4.5:1.</p>
