	The build-anchor scrip is an on-demand script chunk that runs when the page loads with a <code>.build-anchor</code> class. The script iterated through the list and builds an anchor tage using specific alpha and/or numeric characters from the path to the <em>Available formats:</em> document. This script is not build to scale for other uses at this time.
